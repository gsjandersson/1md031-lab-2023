1. Goal (form the goal) 
Make a quiz
2. Plan (the action)

The GUI changes when you resize the window making it a little bit harder to create a quiz:
Some buttons change like the "create" button, it becomes a plus. 
The circle for marking the right answer become smaller and sometimes when clicked something else 
pops up blocking the request to mark the right answer, frustrating. 

Otherwise the creation of the quiz went smoothly. The subject has previous kahoot experience. s
