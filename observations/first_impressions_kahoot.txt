1. Create exists on front page when logged in. 
Button is blue and stands out. 
A lot of stuff other than create exists. I can see my grandma getting confused. 
Only says "create" and not "create quiz". Two options: on for quiz and one for course.
2. It actually says "kahoot" and not quiz. If one is unfamiliar with kahoot that might be confusing. 
During the briefing before my study I will tell them to create a quiz and not a kahoot,
but it's very likely that they know what kahoot is. 
3. Several choices with short explanations to what they are. 
4. Directly in to GUI. 
5. Easy to add question and alternatives. 
6. Functions that are the most likely you want to perform are in a distinct blue. Therefore easy to spot. 
7. If you miss to add an answer and try to save the quiz it will prompt you to do so. Safety net. 
8. When you're finished it gives you the three most likely things you want to use your kahoot for. 

Only few steps from logging in to having a finished quiz. Easy to create. 
Most likely choices highlighted. Safety net.
